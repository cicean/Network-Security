This is the initial, didactic, codebase for the contents of the Network Security Through Data Analysis book.  The
didactic branch contains code as form the book, perhaps with bug fixes, but primarily intended to be explanatory
rather than containing all the error checks and support that I'd expect from big-boy code.  In particular, the 
graph code is rolling its own, when you should be using an actual graph library.
